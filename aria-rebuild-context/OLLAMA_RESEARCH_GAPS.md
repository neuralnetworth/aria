# Ollama Research Gaps

## Critical Unknowns
These questions must be answered before implementation can begin. Use MCP server to research Ollama documentation, GitHub issues, and community resources.

## 1. Model Management

### Model Naming and Versions
- **Question**: How does Ollama name the Qwen2.5-14B model?
  - Is it `qwen2.5:14b` or `qwen2.5:14b-instruct`?
  - How to specify quantization (Q4, Q5, Q6_K, Q8)?
  - Can we pin specific model versions/hashes?
  
### Model Availability
- **Question**: How to programmatically check if a model is available?
  - API endpoint to list models?
  - How to trigger model download from Python?
  - What happens if model is not downloaded?

### Resource Management
- **Question**: How does Ollama manage GPU memory?
  - Can we control GPU layers like llama.cpp?
  - How to optimize for RTX 4080 Super (16GB)?
  - Does it automatically unload models?
  - Multiple model loading strategies?

## 2. API Integration Details

### Streaming Response Format
- **Question**: Exact structure of streaming responses?
  ```python
  # Need to verify actual format:
  # Is it JSON lines?
  # What fields are available?
  # How to detect end of stream?
  ```

### Context Management
- **Question**: How to maintain conversation context?
  - Does Ollama manage context internally?
  - How to pass previous messages?
  - Context window limitations?
  - Format for system prompts?

### Advanced Parameters
- **Question**: What parameters can we control?
  - Temperature, top_k, top_p support?
  - Repetition penalty?
  - Custom stop sequences?
  - Seed for reproducibility?

## 3. Performance Optimization

### Latency Optimization
- **Question**: How to minimize response latency?
  - Keep model loaded between requests?
  - Connection pooling strategies?
  - Optimal chunk sizes for streaming?
  
### Concurrent Requests
- **Question**: How does Ollama handle multiple requests?
  - Queue management?
  - Parallel inference support?
  - Resource sharing between requests?

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Connection Management
- **Question**: How to handle connection failures?
  - Ollama server down scenarios
  - Timeout configurations
  - Reconnection strategies
  - Health check endpoints?

### Streaming Interruption
- **Question**: How to handle interrupted streams?
  - Cancel ongoing generation?
  - Partial response handling?
  - Cleanup procedures?

## 5. System Integration

### Python Client Libraries
- **Question**: Best Python client for Ollama?
  - Official ollama-python?
  - Raw HTTP requests?
  - Async support comparison?
  - WebSocket vs HTTP streaming?

### Audio-LLM Synchronization
- **Question**: How to coordinate streaming with TTS?
  - Chunking strategies for natural speech?
  - Handling code blocks and special formatting?
  - Punctuation-based segmentation?

## 6. Configuration and Deployment

### Server Configuration
- **Question**: Ollama server configuration options?
  - Memory limits?
  - GPU selection?
  - Model preloading?
  - API security/authentication?

### Windows-Specific Concerns
- **Question**: Windows deployment considerations?
  - Service vs application mode?
  - Startup configuration?
  - GPU driver compatibility?
