## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (required for flash-attn)
- System dependencies:
  - **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install python3.12-dev portaudio19-dev libopus-dev`
  - **Arch Linux**: `sudo pacman -S python portaudio opus`
  - **macOS**: `brew install portaudio opus`

### Method 1 - Using uv (Recommended)
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package manager that provides better dependency resolution and faster installations.

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/neuralnetwork/aria.git
cd aria

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Method 2 - Using pip (Traditional)
```bash
# Install from pyproject.toml
pip install -e .
# Note: flash-attn requires CUDA Toolkit and may need manual installation
```


(Tested on Arch Linux + NVIDIA GPUs with Python 3.12)

### Syncing Across Multiple Computers
When using uv, you can easily sync your environment across multiple computers:

```bash
# On your first computer (after installation)
git add uv.lock
git commit -m "Add uv.lock for dependency sync"
git push

# On your other computers
git pull
uv sync
```

The `uv.lock` file ensures all your computers use exactly the same package versions.

## Usage
First run will take a while to download all the required models.\
You may edit the default config for your device or use case (change model, specify devices, etc...)\
If you have the resources, strongly recommended to use bigger model and/or bigger quant method.

### Default Model
Aria now uses **Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M-abliterated** (Q6_K quantization) by default:
- Model size: ~12.2 GB
- Recommended VRAM: 16GB+ (works well on RTX 4080 Super)
- Downloads automatically on first run to HuggingFace cache
- Abliterated version (uncensored) for unrestricted responses

### Windows Users with WSL
If you're developing with WSL but running Aria on Windows:
1. Edit code in WSL using your preferred tools
2. Run Aria directly on Windows for best GPU performance
3. Use Windows terminal: `uv run python main.py`
4. Flash-attn builds properly on native Windows with CUDA

### Non server/client mode:

```
python main.py
```
### Server and Client Mode

#### server machine:
```
python server.py 
```

#### client machine (edit client target ip in the config):
```
python client.py
```

## Upcoming Features
* Android client
* Raspberry Pi client
* Ollama support (currently uses GGUF format directly)

## Documentation
